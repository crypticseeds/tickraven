## Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to build a real-time **MCP server** that:

- Receives and processes real-time trade data from the **Binance Testnet** WebSocket feed.
- Uses **TradingView API** for chart data, and decision-making (future expansion).
- Implements a **custom WebSocket transport** for real-time, low-latency communication between the server and trading bot (MCP client).
- Optimizes communication for high-frequency trading (HFT) environments where low-latency is a critical factor.

---

## System Architecture

The system is divided into **two primary components**:

1. **MCP Server**:
   - Manages and processes incoming requests from the trading bot.
   - Implements the **Model Context Protocol** to handle trade orders, market data, and other trade-related operations.
   
2. **MCP Client (Trading Bot)**:
   - The trading bot (or client) will connect to the server via **WebSocket**.
   - It will receive real-time trade data and send trading decisions to the server for execution.

The communication between the server and the client happens through a **custom WebSocket transport** layer that ensures low-latency message transfer.

---

## Components

### MCP Server

The **MCP server** will:

- Listen for incoming WebSocket connections from the client.
- Receive trade requests (buy/sell orders) from the client and execute them on Binance Testnet or TradingView charts.
- Process incoming real-time trade data from Binance WebSocket feeds and send updates to the client.
- Handle error recovery and re-establish connections in case of failures.

### WebSocket Transport

A **custom WebSocket transport** is built to handle high-frequency messages and ensures low-latency communication. This transport:

- Establishes and manages WebSocket connections.
- Converts MCP protocol messages to WebSocket frames and vice versa.
- Handles bidirectional communication for trade data and trade orders.

#### Key Features:
- Persistent WebSocket connections for consistent data flow.
- Fast message parsing and handling with **asyncio** and **websockets** libraries.
- Error handling and reconnect logic for resilience.

### MCP Client (Trading Bot)

The **trading bot** (client) will:

- Connect to the MCP server via WebSocket.
- Receive market updates, price data, and trade status messages.
- Send trade requests to the server for execution.

The client will implement the **MCP protocol** to interact with the server, sending trade orders and receiving updates in real-time.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Used for server and client implementation, leveraging the `asyncio` and `websockets` libraries for low-latency asynchronous operations.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Provides a robust communication framework for handling trade requests, responses, and status updates.
- **Binance API (Testnet)**: Real-time trade data source for market analysis and execution.
- **TradingView API**: For potential future integration (for chart-based decision-making).
- **WebSocket**: Low-latency, real-time bidirectional communication between the server and client.
- **asyncio**: For asynchronous programming, which is critical for handling real-time data efficiently.

---

## Steps to Implement

### 1. **Setup the MCP Server**
   - Implement the **MCP protocol** server to manage connections and process requests.
   - Configure a WebSocket listener to handle incoming connections from clients.
   - Integrate the Binance WebSocket API for receiving real-time market data.

### 2. **Implement the WebSocket Transport**
   - Create a custom WebSocket transport to handle **bidirectional communication**.
   - Establish WebSocket connections to the server and ensure persistent connections.
   - Parse MCP messages and convert them to WebSocket frames and vice versa.
   - Implement error handling and automatic reconnection logic for better resilience.

### 3. **Setup Binance Testnet Connection**
   - Connect to Binanceâ€™s Testnet WebSocket API to receive real-time data.
   - Process the market data and send it to the trading bot (MCP client).
   - Integrate Binance API for executing buy/sell orders based on trading decisions.

### 4. **Implement the MCP Client (Trading Bot)**
   - Build a client that connects to the server via **WebSocket**.
   - Implement the MCP protocol to send trade orders and receive market updates.
   - Ensure that the client can send buy/sell orders and handle responses efficiently.

### 5. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Run both the server and client locally, simulating a real-time trading environment.
   - Verify that messages are transmitted with minimal delay and are properly parsed and handled.

### 6. **Optimization for Low Latency**
   - Fine-tune WebSocket connections for faster message exchange.
   - Minimize the message size to reduce overhead.
   - Test and optimize the error handling and message reconnection logic.

## Optimization for Low Latency

To optimize this system for **low-latency trading**, focus on the following areas:

1. **Persistent WebSocket Connections**: Reconnect logic to ensure the WebSocket connection stays alive for uninterrupted communication.
2. **Message Compression**: Use compression methods (e.g., gzip) for large messages to reduce overhead.
3. **Efficient Message Parsing**: Parse and handle smaller message chunks to improve throughput.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling, ensuring that the system can recover quickly from network or server failures.

## **Challenges**

### **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Limitations**

**Use Case:** SSE is suitable for one-way server-to-client streaming, such as real-time market data or trade alerts.

**Pros:** Simple to set up over HTTP, works well for broadcasting updates.

**Cons:** SSE does not support bidirectional communication, making it unsuitable for sending trade execution commands or acknowledgments back to the server.

**Impact on Trading:** Live trading requires low-latency bidirectional messaging. Using SSE would introduce delays and limit the ability to execute trades efficiently.

**Solution:** Implement a custom WebSocket transport that allows fast, real-time bidirectional communication between the server and client.

### **Implementing a Custom WebSocket Transport**

**Use Case:** MCP allows custom transport protocols, which is critical for ensuring ultra-low latency in a trading environment.

**Pros:** Full control over message serialisation, transport behaviour, and error handling.

**Cons:** Requires additional development effort to optimise for speed, reliability, and connection handling.

**Features:**
Ensuring efficient message parsing and minimal processing overhead.
Implementing reconnection logic to handle dropped WebSocket connections.
Managing backpressure when processing high volumes of market data.

## Security Considerations

Ensure that the WebSocket communication is secure and resilient:

- **TLS Encryption**: Use **wss://** to secure WebSocket connections.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure the server with proper authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to avoid denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that the messages are validated and sanitized to avoid malicious injections or errors.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Trading Strategies**: Implement different trading strategies such as **trend-following**, **mean reversion**, or **arbitrage**.
- **More Data Sources**: Integrate additional APIs (e.g., for more exchanges or more detailed charting data).
- **Machine Learning**: Integrate AI-based decision-making for more intelligent trading.
- **Advanced Metrics & Monitoring**: Implement advanced logging and monitoring to track trading performance and optimize the strategy.
